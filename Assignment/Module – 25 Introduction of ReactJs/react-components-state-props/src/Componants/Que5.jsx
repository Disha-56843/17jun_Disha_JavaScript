    <h3>Que 5: What is Components in React Js?</h3>
    <h4>Answer:</h4>

    <p>In React.js, components are like building blocks for making websites or apps. They're like puzzle pieces that you can put together to create a picture. Each piece, or component, does a specific job, like showing a button or a menu. You can use these components over and over again, which makes building websites easier and faster.</p>
