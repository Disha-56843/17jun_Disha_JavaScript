    <h3>Que 1: What is React Js?</h3>
    <h4>Answer:</h4>
    <p>React is an open-source JavaScript library for
    building user interfaces. It was developed and is
    maintained by Facebook and a community of
    individual developers and companies. <br />

    React is commonly used for building web
    applications and user interfaces, but it can also be
    used for mobile app development. <br />

    It allows developers to create reusable and
    interactive user interface components, making it
    easier to build complex and dynamic front-end
    applications</p>
