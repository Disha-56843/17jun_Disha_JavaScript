    <h3>Que 4: What is CLI command In React Js?</h3>
    <h4>Answer:</h4>

    <p>CLI commands in React.js are like magic spells you can type into your computer to make it do things for you when you're working on a React project. <br /> <br />
    <b>For example</b>, there's one called create-react-app that helps you start a new project easily. Another one is npm start, which tells your computer to run your project so you can see it in your web browser. There are also commands like npm run build for preparing your project to be shown to the world and npm test to check if everything in your project is working correctly. These commands make it easier to work with React and get things done faster.</p>
