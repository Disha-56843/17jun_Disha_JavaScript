    <h3>Que 2: What is NPM in React Js?</h3>
    <h4>Answer:</h4>

    <p>NPM (Node Package Manager) is used in React.js development for managing libraries and dependencies. Key functions include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Package Management: Install and manage libraries and tools.</li>
        <li>Dependency Management: Keep track of and update necessary libraries.</li>
        <li>Scripts Automation: Run tasks like building and testing your project.</li>
        <li>Package Publishing: Share your own libraries with others.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In a React project, you use commands like <u><b>npm install</b></u> to add libraries and <u><b>npm start</b></u> to run the development server. The package.json file keeps track of dependencies and scripts.</p>
