    <h3>Q:5 What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
    &emsp;&emsp; Undeclared variavles are those which are not defined or declared. and undefined variables are those which was declared but not given value to them. <br>

    <h4>Undeclared:</h4>
    When a variable is “undeclared,” it means that it has not been declared or defined in the current scope.This can happen if you try to use a variable without declaring it first, or if you misspell the variable name.
    <h4>Example:</h4>
        &emsp;&emsp;function calc(){ <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;c = a+b; <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;} <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;calc();
            // ReferenceError: c is not declared


    <h4>Undefined</h4>
    "Undefined" variables have been declared in the current scope, but have not been given a value. <br>Undefined is not a keyword. <br>
    If we use 'typeof' operator to get the value of an undeclared variable, we will face the runtime error with the return value as "undefined". <br>The scope of the undeclared variables is always global. 
    <h4>Example:</h4>
        &emsp;&emsp;function calc(){ <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let c;  <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;document.write(c);  <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;} <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;calc();
            // ReferenceError: c is not defined
