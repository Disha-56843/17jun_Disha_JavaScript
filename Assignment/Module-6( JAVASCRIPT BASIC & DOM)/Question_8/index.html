    <h3>Q:8 What is === operator?</h3>
    The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. <br>
    Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
    different. <br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>If the operands are of different types, return false.</li>
        <li>If both operands are objects, return true only if they refer to the same object.</li>
        <li>If both operands are null or both operands are undefined, return true.</li>
        <li>If either operand is NaN, return false.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, compare the two operand's values:
            <ul>
                <li>Numbers must have the same numeric values. +0 and -0 are considered to be the same value.</li>
                <li>Strings must have the same characters in the same order.</li>
                <li>Booleans must be both true or both false.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; "hello" === "hello"; // true <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"hello" === "hola"; // false <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1 === 1; // true <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; "1" === 1; // false
