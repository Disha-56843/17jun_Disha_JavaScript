    <h3>Q:4 Which company developed JavaScript?</h3><br><hr><hr><hr><br><br>
    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. <br>
    Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>

    After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.<br> Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).<br>
    Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1). <br><br>

    <h3>The ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers Association) Technical Committee 39</h3>
    In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language. <br><br>

    <p>It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.</p>
